- **Contains**: Update notification, who made changes

### 3. Manager Change Email
- **Sent when**: Admin changes someone's manager
- **Sent to**: Employee, new manager, old manager
- **Contains**: Before/after reporting structure

### 4. Department Change Email

if (shouldSendEmail) {
  await sendWelcomeEmail(profile)
}
